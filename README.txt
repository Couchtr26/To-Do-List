# LocalStorage To-Do List

A simple client-side To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  
This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, array management, and browser-based data persistence using LocalStorage.

---

## Features

- ✅ Add new tasks
- ✅ Delete tasks
- ✅ Persistent storage (tasks saved even after refresh)
- ✅ Simple, clean UI
- ✅ Fully functional with no server/backend required

---

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- LocalStorage API

---

## File Structure

/index.html --> Main page structure
/style.css --> Styling for the app
/script.js --> Application logic and storage handling

---

## How It Works

- On page load, tasks are loaded from `localStorage` (if any exist).
- New tasks are added through a form, and immediately stored in `localStorage`.
- Tasks can be deleted, which updates both the DOM and the storage.
- The entire application is 100% client-side.

---

## Future Improvements (if expanded)

- Mark tasks complete / incomplete.
- Add edit functionality.
- Add due dates or priorities.
- Sync with cloud storage or backend.
- Mobile responsive improvements.
